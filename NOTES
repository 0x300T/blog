# TODO/ideas

## dm-tools

* Don't add .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG in mru-files
* Use traits for the various caches


## Kakoune

* Better spell checking:
  * Spell check in realtime
  * Easy addition of word under cursor to
    personnal dict
    (Maybe write a LSP server that knows how to spellcheck?)
  * Automatically enable English speller for markdown, git commit files
  * Do something with cmd-history ?
* Put just the buffer name in the terminal title (hint: not that easy)
