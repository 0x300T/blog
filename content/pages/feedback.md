speak up!

## e-mail


Here's my e-mail, encrypted with a very secure algorithm:

If you can't decrypt this, feel free to leave a comment anywhere with your
e-mail address and I'll get back to you.

## comments

Comments on this blog are powered by [isso](https://posativ.org/isso/).
Here are a few things you need to know:

* Your comments are stored (hopefully safely) on my server. I make daily
  backups.
* Sorry, you can't see them if you choose to block `javascript`. (This has the
  nice effect of greatly reducing spam, without using CAPTCHAs)
* When you leave a comment, you have the choice to fill the 'e-mail' field.
  I won't share it with anyone, and I'll use it to contact you directly if
  needed. But please note that you *won't* get automatic notifications by mail.
* After you submit your comment, you'll have 15 minutes to edit or delete it
  (If you are wondering, this works with a secret token stored in a cookie).
