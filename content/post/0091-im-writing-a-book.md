# History

* Wanted to have a blog for a *long* time
* Spent a lot of time looking for a platform
* Decided to stop looking and just write and publish stuff (thanks dotclear)
* Finally got content published after several years!
* Got too much spam, started a static blog
* Re-added comments with isso
* Started a series about C++ called "Let's build chuck norris"
* Enjoyed it, started a series about CI (also wanted to write about that for a long time)
* Series did not work. You can't really modify a previously published article which is not
  a problem if you know exactly what you are going to tell when
* So decided to start a book!

# Tracking progress

Sources will be open, because why not

The two first article will be the first two chapters

Let's meet in a year and see where we're at :)
