Just a quick post to kindly ask you to make sure your email is verified on both pypi.org and test.pypi.org

# What to do

Ff you have an account on either pypi.org or test.pypi.org, please make sure that you email is verified, and if not, ask for a confirmation email to be sent.

Whether or not you have an account, feel free to spread the news using those links:

- [announce on twitter](https://twitter.com/thepypa/status/1019040253020123137)
- [announce on distutils-sig@python.org](https://mail.python.org/mm3/archives/list/distutils-sig@python.org/message/5ER2YET54CSX4FV2VP24JA57REDDW5OI/)

You can also re-use this article on your own blog for instance ;) [^1]

# Why this matters

pypi.org is essential to lots of python developers, but is unfortunately maintained by a tiny number of great people and they need our help.

If we donâ€™t help them, pypi.org may become unable to send _any_ email, period, which will make things really complicated for everyone.

# More details

The full explanation is also [on GitHub](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/3632) if you want to take a look.

Thanks for your help in keeping pypi.org working!
