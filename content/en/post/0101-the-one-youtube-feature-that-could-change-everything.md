_Note: this the third post in the [Quantum of Ideas]({{< ref "/post/0057-introducing-quantom-of-ideas.md" >}}) series._

This is an idea that came to me after a discussion with friends. I'm sharing it here to give you something to think about, but above all else I'd really like to *discuss* the merits of this idea. To that end, I'd like to remind you that:

* I follow [Crocker's rules], so you can call me an idiot and I won't get offended
* There are lots of ways to [contact] me

Befor

Also, I'd really like to get opinions from *creators* on YouTube: they are the ones that produce the contents we watch there, and they would be the ones impacted by this change.

With this out of the way, let me present you my idea.

# A simple dialog

As soon as you're done watching a video, a dialog like this would appear:

```
Publishing this video on YouTube probably took a long time and effort.
What do you want to do?

I choose to not pay for this video   |  I want to pay for this video, and
                                     |  I'd like to give this amount:
                                     |
[x]                                  |      [   ] $
```

This is what we call "prix libre" in French. The litteral translation (free price) means [something different](). I guess we could call it a pay-what-you-want system.

# What this will change

I think a mechanism like this will change the incentive for YouTube
