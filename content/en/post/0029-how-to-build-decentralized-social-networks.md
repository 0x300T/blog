## Introduction

As free and open source software folks, we usually don't like
the fact that social media giants (twitter, facebook) are
closed-source software and have little concern for their user's privacy.

<!--more-->

To cope with this, we tend to try and replicate their functionality, but
because we believe in a open and neutral internet, we always seek to
build software that is "decentralized".

This has given a some great open-source projects such as
diaspora or the whole framasoft project, but let's face it,
it's still hard to explain to our friends and family why they should
go away from the corporate giants...

Let's not forget that building truly de-centralized software is _hard_, building
monolithic sites is much easier.

So, what should we do?

## Spoiler

Here is the idea:

* We create the most simple twitter clone we can named ynxice[^1]
* We do everything we can to make sure deploying a ynxice instance is _really_
  easy
* We make sure than no ynxice instance can hold more than 300 users

Yup, the fact there can't be more than 300 users is a _feature_.


#### To Be Continued ...

*Note*: this is a copy of an abstract I've submitted to
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/) for a lighting
talk, but I since realized I've missed the deadline.

* It's possible I'll be able to give the talk anyway, but I won't know the date
  in advance, sorry.
* Whatever happens, I'll publish the rest of the post somewhere in the second
  week of February 2017, but not before.
