summary: Introducing a new series about CI
---

I've spent several years working on CI scripts and infrastructure. I've used many tools (Jenkins, Travis, GitLab CI, ...). I've made a lot of mistakes, and I learned a few things I thought I might share here.

The topic of CI is *huge*, so as I did for *[Let's Build Chuck Norris!]({{< ref "/post/0060-introducing-the-chuck-norris-project.md" >}})* and *[Quantum of Ideas]({{< ref "/post/0057-introducing-quantom-of-ideas.md" >}})*, I'll be writing several articles in the following weeks.

Here's the list of articles published so far (you can also find them [listed with the *ci* tag](/tags/ci)):

* [Part 1: CI scripts are scary]({{< ref "/post/0083-tips-from-a-build-farmer-part-1-ci-scripts-are-scary.md" >}})
* [Part 2: Some concepts]({{< ref "/post/0084-tips-from-a-build-farmer-part-2-some-concepts.md" >}})

  _Update: This series has been cancelled. I am [writing a book]({{< ref "/post/0091-im-writing-a-book.md" >}}) instead!_
