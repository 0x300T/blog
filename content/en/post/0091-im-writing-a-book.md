# Why?

I wanted to talk about CI for a very long time (more than 2 years). But it's a huge topic, and it took me some time before I decided to [start a blog post series ]({{< ref "/post/0082-introducing-tips-from-a-build-farmer.md" >}}) about it.

But then I realized that was the wrong format: you see, writing and publishing one post at a time requires for you to know exactly what to say and in what order, and I found that was not the case for the "Tips From A Build Farmer" series. So instead, I am going to try and write the whole thing as a book.

# How?

For now, I am only focusing on the *content*: I just have a bunch of Markdown files I can turn into a big pdf thanks to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

Once done, I will probably publish the pdf and the sources on the Internet, available for free.

# When?

I have no clue at all, this is my first attempt at writing a book! But I will surely post updates there on the blog -- wish me luck!
