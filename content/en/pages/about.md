# About me

My name is Dimitri Merejkowsky (not to be confused with the Russian author with
the same name :)

I'm a French software writer [^1], and I like sharing knowledge and learn from
others, hence this blog.

My twitter bio reads:

> ResponsibleCoder. Scrum Master. Buildfarm guru. Python3 fan.
