My name is Dimitri Merejkowsky (not to be confused with the Russian author with
the same name :)

I'm a French software writer [^1], and I like sharing knowledge and learn from
others, hence this blog.

My twitter bio reads:

> ResponsibleCoder. Scrum Master. Buildfarm guru. Python3 fan.

'nuff said ...

[^1]: I prefer the term "software writer" to the more conventional "software engineer" phrasing. Go watch the talk [Writing Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M) by David Heinemeier Hansson to learn why.
